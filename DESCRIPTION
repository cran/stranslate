Description: Message translation is often managed with 'po' files and the 'gettext' programme, 
    but sometimes another solution is needed. In contrast to 'po' files, a more flexible approach 
    is used as in the Fluent <https://projectfluent.org/> project with R Markdown snippets. 
    The key-value approach allows easier handling of the translated messages.
